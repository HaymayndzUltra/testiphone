3. **Test Frequently**: Test after every major change
4. **Document As You Go**: Don't leave documentation for last
5. **Commit Often**: Small, frequent commits are better
6. **Seek Feedback**: Get code reviews when possible
7. **Automate Early**: Setup CI/CD from the beginning

## 🛠️ Tools You'll Need

**For Code:**
- Python 3.8+
- pytest for testing

3. **Search Online**: Look for similar implementations
4. **Ask for Help**: Don't hesitate to ask
5. **Simplify**: Break down complex tasks

### Common Issues:

**"I don't know where to start"**
→ Start with `ENHANCEMENT_CHECKLIST.md`, do the critical items first

**"The documentation is confusing"**
→ Read the code, code is the true documentation

**"I don't have enough time"**
→ Focus on critical fixes first, improvements can wait

**"What should I prioritize?"**
→ Fix bugs > Add security > Improve code > Add features
